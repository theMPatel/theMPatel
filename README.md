I'm a self taught software engineer that started out as a Biologist.
In my free time I like to read, exercise, cook and code.
I'm always on the lookout for hard problems and great people to solve them with.
Currently, I'm working on interesting Big Data problems at [FullStory](https://www.fullstory.com/).
